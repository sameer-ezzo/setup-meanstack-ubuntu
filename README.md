# setup-ubuntu-mean-stack
MEAN Stack Developer's Toolkit for Ubuntu: Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, Docker, NVM, Antigen, PNPM, and more. Streamline setup and boost productivity!


This repository is a comprehensive collection of scripts and installation guides tailored specifically for MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack developers on Ubuntu systems. The goal is to streamline the setup process and provide a consistent development environment, empowering developers to focus on building amazing applications without worrying about the initial configuration.

Key Features:

Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh: We embrace the power and flexibility of Zsh, a robust shell, and enhance it with Oh-My-Zsh, a community-driven framework that extends its capabilities further. Say goodbye to the standard Bash shell and welcome an improved command-line experience with Zsh.

Docker: Simplify the process of containerizing your applications with Docker. Docker enables seamless deployment and isolation, ensuring consistent behavior across various environments, making development and testing more efficient.

Node Version Manager (NVM): Effortlessly manage multiple versions of Node.js with NVM. Switch between different Node.js versions without hassle, ensuring compatibility with various projects and dependencies.

Antigen: Supercharge your Zsh experience with Antigen, a plugin manager that allows you to easily add themes, plugins, and more to customize your shell according to your preferences.

PNPM: Optimize your Node.js package management with PNPM, a fast and efficient package manager that saves disk space and speeds up installation and updates of dependencies.

Installation Instructions:
Clone or download this repository and execute the provided installation scripts to set up your development environment with ease. The scripts will take care of installing Zsh, Oh-My-Zsh, Docker, NVM, Antigen, and PNPM, along with their respective configurations for seamless integration.

Start your MEAN stack development journey on Ubuntu with confidence, knowing that your environment is set up with the best tools and practices at your fingertips. Focus on creating exceptional applications, leaving the repetitive setup tasks behind.

Happy coding and enjoy the power of MEAN on Ubuntu!

Usage Instructions:
Clone this repository to your device by running the following command:
